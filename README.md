| ! | Stock | PlumOS | Rocknix |

| Stability: | Random Crashes | Mostly Stable*(n1) | Stable |
| Scraper: | Yes | No(Broken) | Yes |
| Game Switcher: | No | No | No |
| Boot to Game: | No | No | Partial*(n2) |

## Notes:
- n1: PlumOS stability depends on the random quality of your Ram. Most will have no issue but some will have to use a version with a slightly lower Clock Speed(i.e PlumOS 0.9). In very rare cases you may have to replace the DTB file to heavily reduce Clock Speeds.
- n2: Rocknix has the option to immediately open a game and continue at the last auto save state when opening a rom file (Retroarch Only).
- n3: Some Portmaster Games will not work due to outdated libraries.
